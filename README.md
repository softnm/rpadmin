# rpadmin
RP Admin simplifies recurring tasks like CRUD with schema writing as easy as a Multidimensional Array Language. Build headless backends at light speed! Now launching as open source to share our vision, this tool is already industry-proven at scale. Join us to revolutionize backend development with unmatched speed and simplicity.

# Rapid Admin (RP Admin) 🚀

**Rapid Admin** is a lightweight, high-speed engine built on **Core PHP**. It is designed to automate recurring backend tasks—like CRUD generation and API routing—using a unique "Schema-as-a-Code" approach. 

By defining your backend via **Multidimensional PHP Arrays**, you can deploy a headless backend at the speed of light without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

## 💡 The Philosophy
The "Rapid" in **Rapid Admin** comes from treating your backend as a data structure rather than a series of files. If you can write a PHP array, you can build an enterprise-level backend. This project is currently **Open Source** to demonstrate this unique architectural idea to the developer community.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
Ensure your Apache server has `mod_rewrite` enabled to handle the headless routing.
